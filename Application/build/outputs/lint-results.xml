        id="InlinedApi"
        severity="Warning"
        message="Field requires API level 13 (current min is 7): `android.R.style#TextAppearance_Holo_Medium`"
        category="Correctness"
        priority="6"
        summary="Using inlined constants on older versions"
        explanation="This check scans through all the Android API field references in the application and flags certain constants, such as static final integers and Strings, which were introduced in later versions. These will actually be copied into the class files rather than being referenced, which means that the value is available even when running on older devices. In some cases that&apos;s fine, and in other cases it can result in a runtime crash or incorrect behavior. It depends on the context, so consider the code carefully and device whether it&apos;s safe and can be suppressed or whether the code needs tbe guarded.

If you really want to use this API and don&apos;t need to support older devices just set the `minSdkVersion` in your `build.gradle` or `AndroidManifest.xml` files.
If your code is *deliberately* accessing newer APIs, and you have ensured (e.g. with conditional execution) that this code will only ever be called on a supported platform, then you can annotate your class or method with the `@TargetApi` annotation specifying the local minimum SDK to apply, such as `@TargetApi(11)`, such that this check considers 11 rather than your manifest file&apos;s minimum SDK as the required API level.

        category="Correctness"
        priority="6"
        summary="Attribute unused on older versions"
        explanation="This check finds attributes set in XML files that were introduced in a version newer than the oldest version targeted by your application (with the the `minSdkVersion` attribute).

This is not an error; the application will simply ignore the attribute. However, if the attribute is important to the appearance of functionality of your application, you should consider finding an alternative way to achieve the same result with only available attributes, and then you can optionally create a copy of the layout in a layout-vNN folder which will be used on API NN or higher where you can take advantage of the newer attribute.

Note: This check does not only apply to attributes. For example, some tags can be unused too, such as the new `&lt;tag>` element in layouts introduced in API 21."
